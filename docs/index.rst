Flask-Classful
==============


.. module:: flask_classful

``Flask-Classful`` is an extension that adds class-based views to Flask.
But why?

I ❤ Flask. Like a lot. But sometimes projects get a little big
and I need some way of managing and organizing all the different
pieces. I know what you're saying: "But what about Blueprints?"

You're right. Blueprints are pretty awesome. But I found that they
aren't always enough to encapsulate a specific context the way I
need. What I wanted, no what I *needed* was to be able to group
my views into relevant classes each with their own context and
behavior. It's also made testing really nifty too.

"OK, I see your point. But can't I just use the base classes in
``flask.views`` to do that?"

Well, yes and no. While ``flask.views.MethodView`` does
provide some of the functionality of ``flask_classful.FlaskView``,
it doesn't quite complete the picture by supporting methods that
aren't part of the typical CRUD operations for a given resource, or
make it easy for me to override the route rules for particular views.
And while ``flask.views.View`` does add some context, it requires
a class for each view instead of letting me group very similar
views for the same resource into a single class.

"But my projects aren't that big. Can ``Flask-Classful`` do
anything else for me besides making a big project easier to manage?"

Why yes. It does help a bit with some other things.

For example, ``Flask-Classful`` will automatically generate routes based on the methods
in your views, and makes it super simple to override those routes
using Flask's familiar decorator syntax.

About ``Flask-Classful`` vs ``Flask-Classy`` and how to migrate
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fork of the original ``Flask-Classy`` for continued development
since the original project has ceased updates. For more information,
see: https://github.com/apiguy/flask-classy/issues/80

To switch from ``Flask-Classy`` to ``Flask-Classful``, you just need to update
the module import, as the APIs are the same for both::

    from flask_classy => from flask_classful

Installation
------------

Install the latest extension with::

    $ pip install flask-classful -U


Let's see how it works
----------------------

If you're like me, you probably get a better idea of how to use something
when you see it being used. Let's go ahead and create a little app to
see how ``Flask-Classful`` works::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask_classful import FlaskView

    # we'll make a list to hold some quotes for our app
    quotes = [
        "A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man! ~ Jebediah Springfield",
        "If there is a way to do it better... find it. ~ Thomas Edison",
        "No one knows what he can do till he tries. ~ Publilius Syrus"
    ]

    app = Flask(__name__)

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            return "<br>".join(quotes)

    QuotesView.register(app)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

Run this app and open your web browser to: http://localhost:5000/quotes/

As you can see, it returns the list of quotes. But what if we just wanted
one quote? What would we do then?

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            id = int(id)
            if id < len(quotes):
                return quotes[id]
            else:
                return "Not Found", 404

Now direct your browser to: http://localhost:5000/quotes/1/ and you should
see the very poignant quote from the esteemed Mr. Edison.

That's cool and all, but what if we just wanted a random quote? What then?
Let's add a random view to our FlaskView::

    from random import choice

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

        def random(self):
            return choice(quotes)

And point your browser to: http://localhost:5000/quotes/random/ and see
that a random quote is returned each time. Voilà!

So by now you must be keenly aware of the fact that you have not defined a
single route, but yet routing is obviously taking place. "Is this voodoo?"
you ask?

Not at all. ``Flask-Classful`` will automatically create routes for any method
in a FlaskView that doesn't begin with an underscore character.
You can still define your own routes of course, and we'll look at that next.



Using custom routes
-------------------

So let's pretend that `/quotes/random/` is just too unsightly and we must
fix it to be something more spectacular forthwith. In a moment of blind
inspiration we decide that getting a random quote is on par with receiving
a rasher of your favorite porcine delicacy. The new URL should be `/quotes/word_bacon/`
so that everyone knows what a treat they are in for.

::

    from flask_classful import FlaskView, route

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

        @route('/word_bacon/') #<--- Adding route
        def random(self):
            return choice(quotes)

Load up http://localhost:5000/quotes/word_bacon/ in your browser and behold
your latest achievement.

The route decorator takes exactly the same parameters as Flask's `app.route`
decorator, so you should feel right at home adding custom routes to any
views you create.

.. note::
    If you want to use other decorators with your views, you'll need to
    make sure that the ``@route`` decorators are first.

So far, all of our URLs have been prefixed by that `/quotes` bit and you
have probably deduced that it was derived from the name of your FlaskView
instance (minus the "View" suffix, of course.) "That's all well and good,"
you're saying, "but how do I change that? What if I want my views at the
root?" Well, person, I have an answer for you.


``Flask-Classful``'s way of talking about "routes"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OK, so I don't want to start inventing a new language (actually I'd love to
invent a new language, just not right now...) for talking about URLs, but
since ``Flask-Classful`` gives you a lot of flexibility in customizing your routes
we might as well make sure we're talking about the same things when we talk
about what you can do.

What you see below is a route comprised of a route prefix, and a route base:

    /neat_prefix/great_base/

The prefix `/neat_prefix/` is only included if you explicitly specify 
a prefix for the FlaskView, otherwise no prefix will be applied.

The route base `/great_base/` will always exist, either because it was
inferred automatically from the name of the FlaskView class, or because you
specified a route base to use.

.. note::
    ``Flask-Classful`` favors putting trailing slashes at the end of routes without parameters.
    You can override this behavior by specifying `trailing_slash=False` either
    as an attribute of your `FlaskView` or in the `register` method.


Specifying a Route Prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A route prefix is a great way to define a common base to URLs. For example lets
say you had a bunch of views that were all part of your application's API system.

You *could* write custom route bases for all of them, but if you want to use
``Flask-Classful``'s (admittedly amazing) automatic route generation stuff you'll lose
the part where it infers the route base from the name of the class.

A better choice is to use a route prefix.

You can specify a route prefix either as an attribute of the `FlaskView`, or when you
register the `FlaskView` with the application.

As an attribute:
****************

Using an attribute is a great way to define a default prefix, as you can always
override this value when you register the `FlaskView` with your app::

    class BurgundyView(FlaskView):
        route_prefix = '/colors/'

        def index(self):
            ...

When registering:
*****************

Alternatively (or additionally, if you like) you can specify a route prefix when
you register the route with your app::

    BurgundyView.register(app, route_prefix='/redish_colors/')

And this will override any route prefixes set on the `FlaskView` class itself.



Customizing the Route Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 2 ways to customize the base route of a `FlaskView`. (Well
technically there are 3 if you count changing the name of the class
but that's hardly a reasonable way to go about it.)

Method 1:
*********

The first method simply requires you to set a `route_base` attribute on
your `FlaskView`. Suppose we wanted to make our QuotesView handle the
root of the web application::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        route_base = '/'

        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

        @route('/word_bacon/')
        def random(self):
            ...

Method 2:
*********

The second method is perfect for when you're using app factories, and
you need to be able to specify different base routes for different apps.
You can specify the route when you register the class with the Flask app
instance::

    QuotesView.register(app, route_base='/')

The second method will always override the first, so you can use method
one, and override it with method two if needed. Sweet!

A few words on ``register``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you've probably seen by now, the ``register`` method is integral to
``Flask-Classful``'s usage and is pretty frickin' powerful. But, how does it
work under the hood?

Internally, ``register`` grabs all methods defined directly on the View Class
given to it, ignoring methods from any base classes. From there, we inspect
the names of the methods and the configuration attributes on the class and
construct a valid URL Rule. We then merely call Flask's own ``add_url_rule``
with the configuration we've gathered.

What does this mean for you? Well, it means you can pass any argument that
``add_url_rule`` takes to ``register`` and it will be passed to every single
``add_url_rule`` call we make when registering the class! Want all methods
on a View to redirect elsewhere? Try calling ``register`` like so::

    RedirectView.register(app, redirect_to='my/new/route')
    
For more information on what you can pass, see Werkzeug's own documentation for
`werkzeug.routing.Rule <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/routing/#werkzeug.routing.Rule>`_.


Well ... more words on ``register``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you may want to pass additional information to the inherited ``FlaskView``
classes. One possible solution could be to use global objects (well, you could even
join Darth Vader on the dark side and your mom wouldn't be proud either) but this is not
the best pattern.

Instead it is possible to pass an additional parameter to the ``register`` method
called ``init_argument``.

When it is passed with a value different than ``Nothing``, ``Flask-Classful`` will
create the inherited ``FlaskView`` instance passing this parameter to the constructor.

Note that this parameter is unique, you can pass complex structures using as this
parameter either tuples or dictionaries.

Let's see an example of this additional parameter in the ``register`` method::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask_classful import FlaskView

    app = Flask(__name__)

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def __init__(self, my_init_argument):
            self._my_init_argument = my_init_argument

        def index(self):
            return self._my_init_argument

    QuotesView.register(app, init_argument="Fistro diodenarl de abajorl")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()


Using multiple routes for a single view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What happens when you need to apply more than one route to a specific view
(for what it's worth, Flask core developer Armin Ronacher `says doing that is
a bad idea <http://stackoverflow.com/a/7876088/105987>`_). But since you're so
determined let's see how to do that anyway.

So let's say you add the following routes to one of your views::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        route_base = '/'

        @route('/quote/<id>')
        @route('/quote/show/<id>')
        def show_quote(self, id):
            ...

That would end up generating the following 2 routes:

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/<id>
**endpoint** QuotesView:show_quote_1
**method**   GET
============ ================================

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/show/<id>
**endpoint** QuotesView:show_quote_0
**method**   GET
============ ================================

"Oh weird! What's with all the _0 and _1 stuff?" you ask in disgust. Well
first I want to know how you managed to pronounce _0. But really the reason
is that since there is more than one route, an index is added to prevent an
endpoint collision. This differs from the default behavior of `Flask`, which
allows you to create collisions.


Specify your own damn endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you don't like the nifty indexing trick? Well fine then. I guess you can
go ahead and specify your own endpoint if you like but that's only because I
like you.

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        route_base = '/'

        @route('/quote/<id>', endpoint='show_quote')
        @route('/quote/show/<id>')
        def show_quote(self, id):
            ...

Will generate the following routes:

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/<id>
**endpoint** show_quote
**method**   GET
============ ================================

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/show/<id>
**endpoint** QuotesView:show_quote_0
**method**   GET
============ ================================

Special method names
--------------------

So I guess I have to break the narrative a bit here so I can take some
time to talk about ``Flask-Classful``'s special method names.

Here's the thing. `FlaskView` is smart. No, not solving differential
equations smart, but let's just say it knows how to put the round peg
in the round hole. When you register a `FlaskView` with an app,
`FlaskView` will look for special methods in your class. Why? Because
I care. I know that sometimes you just want things to just *work* and
not have to think about it. Let's look at `FlaskView`'s very special
method names:

**index**
    Woah... you've seen this one before! Remember way back at the
    beginning? Oh nevermind. So *index* is generally used for home pages
    and lists of resources. The automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /
    **endpoint** <class name>:index
    **method**   GET
    ============ ================================

**get**
    Another old familiar friend, `get` is usually used to retrieve a
    specific resource. The automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:get
    **method**   GET
    ============ ================================

**post**
    This method is generally used for creating new instances of a resource
    but can really be used to handle any posted data you want. The
    automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /
    **endpoint** <class name>:post
    **method**   POST
    ============ ================================

**put**
    For those of us using REST this one is really helpful. It's generally
    used to update a specific resource. The automatically generated route
    is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:put
    **method**   PUT
    ============ ================================

**patch**
    Similar to `put`, `patch` is used for updating a resource. Unlike `put`
    however you only send the parts of the resource you want changed,
    instead of doing a complete replacement of the resource. The automatically
    generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:patch
    **method**   PATCH
    ============ ================================

**delete**
    More RESTfulness. It's the most self explanatory of all the RESTful
    methods, and it's commonly used to destroy a specific resource. The
    automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:delete
    **method**   DELETE
    ============ ================================


url_for art thou, Romeo?
--------------------------

Sorry that's a terrible name for a section header, but naming things is what
am the least skilled at, so please bear with me.

Once you've got your `FlaskView` registered, you'll probably want to be able
to get the URLs for it in your templates and redirects and whatnot. `Flask`
ships with the awesome `url_for` function that does an excellent job of
turning a function name into a URL that maps to it. You can use `url_for`
with ``Flask-Classful`` by using the format "<Class name>:<method name>". Let's
look at an example::

    class DuckyView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            return "Duckies!"

        def get(self, name):
            return "Duck %s" % name

        @route('/do_duck_stuff', endpoint='do_duck_stuff')
        def post(self):
            return "Um... Quack?"

In this example, you can get a URL to the index method using::

    url_for("DuckyView:index")

And you can get a URL to the get method using::

    url_for("DuckyView:get", name="Howard")

And for that view with the custom endpoint defined?::

    url_for("do_duck_stuff")

.. note::
    Notice that the custom endpoint does not get prefixed with the class
    name like the auto-generated endpoints. When you define a custom
    endpoint, we hand that over to Flask in it's original, unaltered form.


Your own methods (they're special too!)
---------------------------------------

Let's talk about how you can add your own methods (like we did with
`random` back in the day, remember? Good times.) If you add your own
methods, `FlaskView` will detect them during registration and register
routes for them, whether you've gone and defined your own, or you just
want to let `FlaskView` do its thing. By default, `FlaskView` will
create a route that is the same as the method name. So if you define a
view method in your `FlaskView` like this::

    class SomeView(FlaskView):
        route_base = "root"

        def my_view(self):
            return "Check out my view!"

`FlaskView` will generate a route like this:

============ ================================
**rule**      /root/my_view/
**endpoint**  SomeView:my_view
**method**    GET
============ ================================

"That's fine." you say. "But what if I have a view method with some
parameters?" Well `FlaskView` will try to take care of that for you
too. If you were to define another view like this::

    class AnotherView(FlaskView):
        route_base = "home"

        def this_view(self, arg1, arg2):
            return "Args: %s, %s" % (arg1, arg2,)

`FlaskView` would generate a route like this:

============ ================================
**rule**     /home/this_view/<arg1>/<arg2>
**endpoint** AnotherView:this_view
**method**   GET
============ ================================

.. note::
    One important thing to note is that `FlaskView` supports `type hints in your
    parameters in Python 3 <#type-hints-support-for-python-3>`_, and if you want or need them in
    Python 2, you'll need to define the route yourself using the `@route` decorator.

Sometimes that you need to use `my-view` instead of default `my_view` generated route, you can
use `method_dashified` attribute when defining the view class or when registering the view with the
app. For example::

    class SomeView(FlaskView):
        route_base = "root"
        method_dashified = True

        def my_view(self):
            return "Check out my view!"

`FlaskView` will generate a route like this:

============ ================================
**rule**      /root/my-view/
**endpoint**  SomeView:my_view
**method**    GET
============ ================================

Out of the box, your custom methods will all be registed as only ``GET`` methods. This is
done because it is simply the default that Flask uses when registering routes without
any HTTP methods specified. If you want to change the default HTTP method your custom
methods respond to, simply define a class level attribute named ``default_methods``
and make it a list of all HTTP methods you want your custom methods to respond to.

For example::

    class DefaultMethodsView(FlaskView):
        default_methods = ['GET', 'POST']
        
        def my_view(self):
            return "Check out my view!"


This will register ``my_view`` as both a ``GET`` and a ``POST`` route. Creating the following
route:

============ ================================
**rule**      /root/my_view/
**endpoint**  SomeView:my_view
**method**    GET, POST
============ ================================

Hiding your own methods (they're not *all* special!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While automatically registering your own methods is awesome and usually
expected, sometimes you write view-level methods that shouldn't be API routes.
Generally, these are private methods prefixed with an `_`. By default,
``Flask-Classful`` will not register a route for any method beginning with an `_`.
However, sometimes you don't have full API control or you are creating a publicly
accessible API that isn't an API endpoint. For example, consider some kind of
setup method your class view has::

    class SetupView(FlaskView):

        def setup(self):
            # do some sort of crazy expensive calculation on demand here
            pass

The intention is for the app to call this after registering the view when some
data that isn't immediately available is ready. As such, this isn't really a
private method, but it also isn't an API endpoint. To prevent ``Flask-Classful``
from registering this as an endpoint, add it to the `excluded_methods` class
property, like so::

    class SetupView(FlaskView):
        excluded_methods = ['setup']

        def setup(self):
            # do some sort of crazy expensive calculation on demand here
            pass


Decorating Tips
---------------

So if you're like me (and who isn't?), you think that class-based views are
frickin' beautiful. But once you've moved in, it's nice to add a little
personal touch, don't you think?

Of course I'm talking about decorators. The `Flask` ecosystem is full of
excellent extensions that allow you to customize a view's behavior
simply by adding a decorator, and you can use them with your
FlaskView's too.::

    class BetterButterView(FlaskView):

        @login_required  # Ain't it pretty?
        def super_secret(self):
            return "It's a secret to everyone."

But what about when you want to add a decorator to every method in your
`FlaskView`? All you need to do is add a `decorators` attribute to the
class definition with a list of decorators you want applied to every
method and ``Flask-Classful`` will take care of the rest::

    class WhataGreatView(FlaskView):
        decorators = [login_required]

        def this_is_secret(self):
            return "If you see this, you're logged in."

        def so_is_this(self):
            return "Looking at me? I guess you're logged in."


Before and After
----------------

Hey, remember that time when you made that big ol' `Flask` app and then
had those ``@app.before_request`` and ``@app.after_request``
decorated methods? Remember how you only wanted some of them to run for
certain views so you had all those ``if view == the_one_I_care_about:``
statements and stuff?

**Yuck.**

I've been there too, and I think you might like how ``Flask-Classful``
addresses this very touchy issue. ``FlaskView`` will look for wrapper
methods when your request is being processed so that you can create more
fine grained "before and after" processing methods.

Wrap all the views in a FlaskView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So there you are, eating a delicious Strawberry Frosted Pop Tart one
morning, thinking about the awesome ``Flask-Classful`` app you deployed the
night before during one of your late night hackathons and it hits you:

*"Tracking! I need to track those widgets!"*

No doubt it's an inspired thought, but in this case it was a tragic
oversight. You realize now how lucky it was that you chose to use
``Flask-Classful`` because adding tracking is going to be a snap::

    from flask_classful import FlaskView
    from made_up_tracking import track_it

    class WidgetsView(FlaskView):

        def before_request(self, name):
            track_it("something is happening to a widget")

        def after_request(self, name, response):
            track_it("something happened to a widget")
            return response

        def post(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

Whew. Crisis averted, am I right? So you go about your day and at lunch time
you hit your favorite Bacon Sandwich place and start daydreaming about your
life as a rockstar ``Flask-Classful`` consultant when suddenly:

*"I really only care about when widgets are created and retrieved!"*

Wrap only specific views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yep, you've got a granularity problem. Not to worry though because
``Flask-Classful`` is happy to let you know that it has *smart* wrapper methods
too. Let's say for example you wanted to run something before the ``index`` view
runs? Just create a method called ``before_index`` and ``Flask-Classful`` will make
sure it gets run only before that view. (as you have guessed by now,
``after_index`` will be run only after the index view).

::

    from flask_classful import FlaskView
    from made_up_tracking import track_it

    class WidgetsView(FlaskView):

        # Will be run before the 'get' view
        def before_get(self):
            track_it("a widget is being accessed")

        # Will be run before the 'post' view
        def after_post(self, response):
            track_it("a widget was created")
            return response

        def post(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

The View Wrappin' Method List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just to be certain, let's go ahead and review the methods you can write to
wrap your views:

**before_request(self, name, *args, **kwargs)**
    Will be called before any view in this ``FlaskView`` is called.

    :name:       The name of the view that's about to be called.


    :\*args:     Any arguments that will be passed to the view.


    :\*\*kwargs: Any keyword arguments that will be passed to the view.


**before_<view_method>(self, *args, **kwargs)**
    Will be called before the view specified <view_method> is called.

    :\*args:     Any arguments that will be passed to the view.


    :\*\*kwargs: Any keyword arguments that will be passed to the view.


**after_request(self, name, response)**
    Will be called after any view in this ``FlaskView`` is called. You must
    return either the passed in response or a new response.

    :name:       The name of the view that was called.


    :response:   The response produced after calling the view.


**after_<view_method>(self, response)**
    Will be called after the <view_method> is called. You must return either
    the passed in response or a new response.

    :response:   The response produced after calling the view.


Order of Wrapped Method Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wrapper methods are called in the same order every time. "How predictable."
you're thinking. (You're starting to sound like my ex, sheesh.) I prefer the
term *reliable*.

1. Any method registered with ``@app.before_request``
2. FlaskView's ``before_request`` method
3. FlaskView's ``before_<view_method>`` method
4. The actual view method
5. FlaskView's ``after_<view_method>`` method
6. FlaskView's ``after_request`` method
7. Any method registered with ``@app.after_request``

Subdomains (getting advanced 'n stuff)
--------------------------------------

By now, you've built a few hundred `Flask` apps using ``Flask-Classful``
and you probably think you're an expert. But not until you've tried
the snazzy `Subdomains` feature my friend.

``Flask-Classful`` allows you to specify a subdomain to be used when
registering routes for your FlaskViews. While the usefulness of this
feature is probably apparent to many of you, let's go ahead and take a
look at one of the many facilitative use cases.

Suppose you've got a sweet API you're porting over from a legacy app
and in the migration you want to clean things up a bit and start using
a subdomain like ``api.socool.biz`` instead of the old way of accessing
it using ``api`` at the root of the path like ``socool.biz/api``. The
only catch, of course, is that you have API clients still using that
old path based method. What is a hard working developer like you to do?

Thanks to `Flask` and ``Flask-Classful`` you have some options. There are two
easy ways you can choose from to tell ``Flask-Classful`` which subdomains your
``FlaskView`` should respond to.

Let's see both methods so you can choose which one works best for your
application.

The Define-During-Registration Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably the most flexible method, you can define which subdomains you
want to support at the same time you're registering your views::

    # views.py

    from flask_classful import FlaskView

    class CoolApiView(FlaskView):

        def index(self):
            return "API stuff"

::

    # main.py

    from flask import Flask
    from views import CoolApiView

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'socool.biz'

    # This one matches URLs like: http://socool.biz/api/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base='/api/')

    # This one matches URLs like: http://api.socool.biz/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base='/', subdomain='api')

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

The Explicit-Define-In-The-FlaskView Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this method, you can explicitly define a subdomain as an attribute of
the ``FlaskView`` subclass::

    # views.py

    from flask_classful import FlaskView

    class CoolApiView(FlaskView):
        subdomain = "api"

        def index(self):
            return "API Stuff"

::

    # main.py

    from flask import Flask
    from views import CoolApiView

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'socool.biz'

    # This one matches URLs like: http://socool.biz/api/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base='/api/', subdomain='')

    # This one matches URLs like: http://api.socool.biz/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base="/")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

As you can see here, specifying the subdomain to the register method will
override the explicit subdomain attribute set inside the class.


Adding Resource Representations (Get real classy and put on a top hat)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
So, you want to use ``Flask-Classful`` to make a RESTful API. Not a problem, we got
you covered. Say you want your API to be able to respond to requests with JSON.
All you have to do is create a class that defines how to serialize and deserialize
the data, add it to the `representations` variable on your `FlaskView`.

Here's the code for the JSON Response class::

    # representations.py
    
    import json
    from flask import make_response

    def output_json(data, code, headers=None):
        content_type = 'application/json'
        dumped = json.dumps(data)
        if headers:
            headers.update({'Content-Type': content_type})
        else:
            headers = {'Content-Type': content_type}
        response = make_response(dumped, code, headers)
        return response

Then go ahead and add this new resource representation to your view::

    # views.py

    from flask_classful import FlaskView
    from .representations import output_json

    class CoolJSONView(FlaskView):
        representations = {'application/json': output_json}

        def index(self):
            return {'This is JSON': 'How Cool is that'}


The ``representations`` attribute is a dictionary in which each key is a content type and the value
is a ``flask.make_response`` proxy function with the same signature.

By default, the ``representations`` class attribute is an empty dictionary.

When the ``representations`` dictionary is not empty and if the view function returns a
``flask.wrappers.ResponseBase`` instance, it will be returned immediately to ``Flask`` to handle
the rest. Otherwise, ``Flask-Classful`` will try to find the best match between the accepted content
types and the keys in the ``representations`` dictionary, and call the associated output proxy
function to create a ``flask.wrappers.ResponseBase`` instance. If no matching output proxy function
is found when ``Flask-Classful`` looks for one, then the data the view returns
is passed straight to ``Flask's`` ``make_response`` and returned as is.

This is an example where the view function returns a ``flask.wrappers.ResponseBase`` instance,
skipping the ``representations`` system entirely::

    # views.py

    from flask import redirect
    from flask_classful import FlaskView
    from .representations import output_json

    class CoolJSONView(FlaskView):
        representations = {'application/json': output_json}

        def redirect(self):
            return redirect("http://flask-classful.teracy.org")


To define a default representation that is used when no other matches are
found, you can add the ``flask-classful/default`` mimetype to your
representations dictionary, like so::

    # views.py

    from flask_classful import FlaskView
    from .representations import output_default, output_json

    class CoolDefaultView(FlaskView):
        representations = {'application/json': output_json,
                           'flask-classful/default': output_default}

        def post(self):
            return {'defaults': 'are cool, yo'}

.. note::
    "Find the best match" means comparing the accepted mimetypes and their
    q-factor weighting to the list of representation mimetypes. That is, Flask
    Classful does no special heuristics in finding this best match. For more
    information, see
    `this MDN article on the Accept header <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept>`_
    or `this snippet <http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/45/>`_ about Werkzeug's ``best_match`` helper.


Type Hints Support for Python 3
-------------------------------

With Python 3, you can use `type hints <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_ for a view
function's arguments. By using these, you can have very simple, and convenient type input validation
and conversion for a view function. If a view function is called with parameters of the wrong type,
the view function will not be called and a ``404`` HTTP status code will be returned.

This is an example of type hinting support::

    # python3 only

    class TypingView(FlaskView):

        def index(self):
            return "Index"

        @route('/<id>', methods=['POST'])
        def post(self, id: str) -> str:
            return "Post"

        def patch(self, id: str) -> str:
            return "Patch"

        def int(self, arg: int):
            return str(arg)

        def float(self, arg: float):
            return str(arg)

        def uuid(self, arg: UUID):
            return str(arg)


This is the current default ``type_hints`` class attribute of the ``FlaskView`` class::

    # supported type hints used to determine url variable converters
    type_hints = {
        str: 'string',
        int: 'int',
        float: 'float',
        UUID: 'uuid',
    }

You can override as much as you wish for your application, see more at
`URL Route Registrations <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#url-route-registrations>`_ and
`flask.Flask.url_map <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#flask.Flask.url_map>`_

In the future, we can add a more sophisticated mechanism for type hinting and conversion.

Disabling Type Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say you're using Python 3 with Type Hints, because types are awesome (just like you),
but you want to disable reading these hints and adding them into your URL Rules. First off,
I'm not really sure why you would ever want to do this, but I'm sure you have a great reason!

Luckily, Classful supports doing just that! Merely add a new class attribute named
``inspect_args`` and set it's value to ``False``, like so::

    class NoInspectArgsView(FlaskView):
        inspect_args = False
        
        def post(self, id: int):
            pass
            
In the above example, even though we're using a Type Hint to say that the ``id`` URL Argument
should be an ``int``, ``Flask Classful`` will ignore this information and continue to pass it to
you as a string. From there, I'm sure you want to coerce arguments in your own fancy way.

Providing your OWN base class
-----------------------------

Just about every programmer who's worked with a major library has discovered some odd issues
with it or has found something they disagree with in its implementation. Many times, the
easiest way to fix this (beyond contributing upstream!) is to define your own base class
that extends the problematic class in question and fixes your gripe. This is a wonderful
way to fix problems and really shows how excellent OOP can be, and, as such, is highly encouraged.

``Flask-Classful`` feels the same way, if you want to sub-class ``FlaskView`` to add whatever
functionality you want, you should do exactly that! However, you should know one thing
before you do this, and that is how ``Flask-Classful`` automatically discovers methods to register
as routes. Whenever ``register`` is called with a ``FlaskView`` subclass, the method inspects
both ``FlaskView`` and the subclass, grabbing the set of methods from both. It then takes
the set of methods defined on ``FlaskView`` and **removes** them from the set of methods
defined on the subclass. This then gives the set of methods that are unique to the subclass
and those methods are registered.

What does this mean to you? It means that all your nifty little helper methods on your base
class... will be registered as routes by default! This is certainly not what you want. The
astute reader will recognize that you can use the ``excluded_methods`` attribute to work around
this. While this will work, it poses some problems. It essentially forces you to maintain a list
of all methods on your base class that you want excluded. All in all, this creates a very
user-unfriendly process.

Now that I've dashed all of your hopes, how about I restore them? This is a problem
``Flask-Classful`` has thought about and addressed, through the usage of the ``base_class`` kwarg on
the ``register`` method. Whenever you call ``register`` on a ``FlaskView`` subclass, you
can pass it the actual base class of the class you're registering. When this is passed,
``Flask-Classful`` will grab the set of methods from the new base class and will not register
any of them. For example::

    class MyBaseView(FlaskView):
        def foo(self):
            return 'foo'
            
    class MyChildView(MyBaseView):
        pass
        
    MyChildView.register(app, base_class=MyBaseView)
    
By passing ``MyBaseView`` as the ``base_class`` to the ``register`` call, we will now
properly ignore ``foo`` and it will not become a route!


Migration
---------

We will avoid introducing breaking changes immediately for a release but should add deprecated warnings
before breaking things for the next version releases to make it always backward-compatible.

However, there are still some breaking changes that you must follow to upgrade ``Flask-Classful``.


From v0.13.1 to v0.14.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The behavior of the trailing slash is changed: redirect by default when no trailing slash, see:

    + https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-classful/issues/47

    => If you don't want to see 301 redirect, set `trailing_slash` option to `False`.

- The behavior of the representations is changed: return content by default when no matching registered
  representation instead of returning the first output from the first registered representation. Allow
  specififying the default representation when no matching with `flask-classful/default` mime type,
  see:

    + https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-classful/issues/72

    => You need to specify the default representation.


From v0.10.0 to v0.11.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The order in which `FlaskView` decorators are applied has been reversed, see:

    + https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-classful/commit/686be6ef6fd09d9c1719fa89763ad09baddf7fd0
    + https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-classful/issues/49

    => You need to make sure the decorators are in the right order.
